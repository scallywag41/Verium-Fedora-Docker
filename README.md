# Verium-Fedora-Docker
Verium-Fedora-Docker

This is a simple Dockerfile to build the verium miner on fedora.  I have modified this code from Pedro Lobo <https://github.com/pslobo>.This is my first docker file so I expect it will change and become more robust with time.

Thanks to Pedro for the initial ubuntu file.
Thanks to TCPSolid for a fedora system to test on and moral support.
