# Verium-Fedora-Docker
Verium-Fedora-Docker

This is a simple Dockerfile to build the verium miner on fedora.  I have modified this code from Pedro Lobo <https://github.com/pslobo>.This is my first docker file so I expect it will change and become more robust with time.


Included is my initial Ansible Playbook.  I am still learning ansible, so this will change as well.


Thanks to Pedro for the initial ubuntu file.

Thanks to TCPSolid for a fedora system to test on and moral support.


If this was helpful for you, run the default for a few minutes to help my hashrate :)
